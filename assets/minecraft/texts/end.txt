§c§nWAIT WAIT PLEASE DON'T SKIP ME!!!



This isn't the usual boring text that you read once and then never read again. This is from the pack creator, TechnoAlli3.

I'd personally like to thank you, PLAYERNAME, for taking the time to play with this resource pack. While there's absolutely no talent or skill in any of the textures I drew, it still took many long hours, for this stuff gets tedious and dull after looking at the same 32x32 canvas for hours on end. I'd like to also thank the Classic Faithful and Faithful teams, who's work was the base of any textures I didn't handdraw myself, like the entity textures. Take a look at the pack description for links.

With those formalities out of the way...


I can't believe you managed to endure this chaotic masterpiece long enough to beat the §5Ender §5Dragon. Kudos to you for putting up with my nonsense.

So what do you plan to do now? Now that you've completed the boss fight? Delete this pack forever? Play some more? No matter what you do, I hope you've enjoyed this.



Best,
TechnoAlli3
